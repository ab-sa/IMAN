# IMAN
Interlog protein network reconstruction, Mapping and Analysis


IMAN is a free and platform free software for reconstructing Interlog Protein Network (IPN) integrated from several Protein-protein Interaction Networks (PPIN). In order to mine the conserved common network between diverse species, users can overlay the different PPINs for each species. IMAN helps to retrieve IPN with different degrees of conservation to employ for better protein function prediction and PPIN analysis.
