# IMAN
Interlog protein network reconstruction, Mapping and Analysis


we want to present “Interlog protein network reconstruction, Mapping and Analysis” software for reconstructing IPN integrated from several Protein-protein Interaction Networks (PPIN). Users can overlay different PPINs to mine conserved common network between diverse species. IMAN helps to retrieve IPN with different degrees of conservation to employ for better protein function prediction and PPIN analysis.
